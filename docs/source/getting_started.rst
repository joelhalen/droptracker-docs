If you are just a user, and you are not in a group that is using the DropTracker, all you need to do is install the plugin. 

You can optionally **`Join our Discord server <https://www.droptracker.io/discord/>`_** and use the **``/claim-rsn``** command to register your Discord account to your User account, so we can ping you when drops/etc you receive are sent to the global drop channel.

# Clans
You **must** have/generate a **WiseOldMan Group ID** `click here <https://www.wiseoldman.net/groups/create>`_.
You can find your WiseOldMan Group ID by visiting the page for your group on their website, then extracting it from the URL.

> To set up a group in the DropTracker, invite the bot to your Discord guild using `this link <https://www.droptracker.io/invite>`_

Once the bot is invited, use the **``/create-group``** command, using your Wise Old Man group ID in the required Group ID parameter.

Following this, you should be presented with a semi-introduction to the DropTracker, and a link to configure your group.
If you aren't provided one, `visit the website and sign in <https://www.droptracker.io/login/discord>`_, then click "Group Settings" on the homepage.
