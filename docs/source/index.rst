Welcome
===================================

The **DropTracker** is a RuneLite plugin that tracks drops, achievements, collection logs, and personal bests at various different bosses through Old School RuneScape.

It pulls data from `WiseOldMan <https://www.wiseoldman.net/>`_ to manage group memberships, name-changes, and various bits of account data.

This documentation intends to ensure that your set-up and use of the DropTracker is as seamless and simple as it possibly can be.

Check out the :doc:`runelite` section for information on our RuneLite plugin, and the :doc:`discord_bot` section for information on our Discord bot.

>> Check out :doc:`getting_started` to get started.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. If you find that something is missing from the docs, please `Reach out <https://www.droptracker.io/discord/>`_.
